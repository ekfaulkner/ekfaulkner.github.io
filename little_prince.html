        <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
            <span style="text-decoration-line:underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> 
            It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. 
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
            <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span> 
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again: 
            <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
            <span style="text-decoration-line:underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extingueshed by a little puff of wind...</span>
